                <p>Teamwork is crucial in everybody's daily life, whether you play a sport or not. In our employment, at home and in our interests, we serve as teams. If you are an athlete, you know more than likely that teams working together win. No individual can win by himself in team sports. TARC Basketball is a team sport which takes a lot of teamwork to win games because each player's success depends on other teammates' performance. See why our TARC Basketball teamwork is crucial to success, especially in team sports such as basketball.</p>
                <p class="title">3 things in order to have good teamwork</p>
                <p>First, Creates Synergy is described as a synergy as an entire component larger than an individual component. When colleagues learn to work together for a same purpose, they can build a team with synergy. Without question, the power of all working together can lead to additional victories.</p>
                <p>Second, Help teammates Motivate each other to work and develop a learning atmosphere which promotes and motivates others. You are more inclined to strive for success and do your best if you know that you have team members that support yourself and depend on you.</p>
                <p>Last, Increases communication since communication in basketball is a key aspect for success. If you work together as a team, your levels of communication both on and off the court will improve and lead to more wins.</p>
